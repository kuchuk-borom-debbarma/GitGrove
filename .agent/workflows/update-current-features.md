Update CurrentFeatures.MD located in docs folder to update it based on the current state of codebase if we are adding a new feature or updating existing design of a feature. Create the file if it doesnt exist. If there has been change in flow or new feature has been added. Skip updating it if it was internal fixes, refactors, etc.
